## Abstract
This paper describes the design, realization and testing of an active ball handling mechanism which is designed for dribbling the ball in the RoboCup Middle Size League used by our team NuBot. First, a virtual model of the simplified ball handling mechanism is derived. Afterwards, a control system including a feedback controller and a feedforward controller is designed and developed step by step. Experimental results show that the ball stays in contact with the robot using the proposed mechanism and control system when the robot is driving forwards, backwards and rotating.
